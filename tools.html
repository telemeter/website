<h2><i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i> Telemeter loves Observability</h2>
<p>You have lots of choices when setting up your team's observability system. We know that none of them are right for every situation and we'll work with you find just the right setup for your needs. Here are some tools we feel are pretty great. We have lots of experience with them and can help you make them purr.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-tachometer"></i> <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">StatsD</a></h2>

It's concepts are widely copied in other implementations. THere are also other, compatible implementations if the original project doesn't fit your operational needs. We also like <a href="http://datadoghq.com">Datadog's</a> <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/">DogStatsD</a> for it's tagging and event extensions.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-tachometer"></i> <a href="https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/">Metrics</a></h2>
<p>Dropwizard's <em>Metrics</em> library is JVM-specific but it's the quentessential client-side aggregation and metric library. It's often cited as inspiration for similar systems in other languages. It's got great flexbility in outputs and is a pleasure to use.</p>
