<h2><i class="fa fa-truck"></i> Build A Metrics Pipeline</h2>
<p>We've got the know how to collect metrics from everything. Open source projects, cloud providers, proprietary software and even your internal development!</p>
<p>We'll help you build a solid pipeline for collecting all this information, getting it stored and bilding great dashboards for monitoring steady state and performing diagnosis.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-binoculars"></i> Monitor Your Services</h2>
<p>We don't just set thresholds, we work with you to identify the <em>right</em> things to monitor so that you only interrupt your people when there is customer impact or other significant problems.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-bug"></i> Collect Errors</h2>
<p>Errors, exceptions and assertions can be vital clues. We'll help capture and account them so you have all the information you need.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-mortar-board"></i> Make Low Interrupt On-Call</h2>
<p>We strongly believe that interrupting your staff after work the is last step. An unused on call is a happy on call! To that end we'll help you instrument your alerting processes to identify problematic alerts and people who might be burning out.</p>
